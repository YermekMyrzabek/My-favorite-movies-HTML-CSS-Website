  <p> <strong>1.The Shawshank Redemption</strong></p>
  <img src="pic2.jpg" alt="poster of movie" width="360" height="510">
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Film-drama was directed by Frank Darabont based on the novel by Stephen King. Do not <br>
    watch this movie once, you are committing a crime against the world of cinema. This tape <br>
    is deservedly called the great or even the greatest. Despite the fact that the film failed <br>
    at the box office originally, now this film is in the forefront of the top rating of the <br>
    best film in the world. Generally it is very difficult to find the right words to describe <br>
    this film, and it aptly describes it. So start watching immediately and you will not regret <br>
    the time spent! <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plot of the film "The Shawshank Redemption": vice-president of the bank Dyufreyn<br>

  <p> <strong>2.The Godfather</strong></p>
  <img src="pic3.jpg" alt="poster of movie" width="360" height="510">
  <br>

  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Godfather "Don" Vito Corleone is the head of the Corleone mafia family in New York. <br>
    He is at the event of his daughter's wedding. Michael, Vito's youngest son and a decorated <br>
    WW II Marine is also present at the wedding. Michael seems to be uninterested in being a part <br>
    of the family business. Vito is a powerful man, and is kind to all those who give him respect <br>
    but is ruthless against those who do not. But when a powerful and treacherous rival wants to <br>
    sell drugs and needs the Don's influence for the same, Vito refuses to do it. What follows is <br>
    a clash between Vito's fading old values and the new ways which may cause Michael to do the <br>
    thing he was most reluctant in doing and wage a mob war against all the other mafia families <br>
    which could tear the Corleone family apart.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also recomend you to watch other parts:

  <img src="pic4.jpg" alt="poster of movie" width="360" height="510">
  <br>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Paris, the aristocratic and intellectual Philippe is a quadriplegic millionaire who <br>
    is interviewing candidates for the position of his carer, with his red-haired secretary <br>
    Magalie. Out of the blue, Driss cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from <br>
    the Social Security and asks Phillipe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position <br>
    so he can receive his unemployment benefit. Philippe challenges Driss, offering him a <br>
    trial period of one month to gain experience helping him. Then Driss can decide <br>
    whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the challenge and moves <br>
    to the mansion, changing the boring life of Phillipe and his employees.
